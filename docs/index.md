# SysAdmin Notes

This is a personal repository of notes, commands and scripts and resources that I have collected during my journey in learning systems and server administration using Unix/Linux and Windows Server 2012. It is not intended to be a complete reference or guide, but more as a cheatsheet/archive of links to more comprehensive resources that are available on the Internet.

This repository has been created using [mkdocs.org](http://mkdocs.org).
